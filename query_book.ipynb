The share of the global container fleet absorbed by delays declined from \\nalmost 14% in January 2022 to 6.7% in October, according to Sea-Intelligence. Nonetheless, \\ninland logistics remained challenged in some regions and ports because of several factors: \\nongoing truck driver and equipment shortages, redirected cargos bound for Russia, low \\nwater levels in parts of Europe, high inventory levels clogging-up ports and warehouses, \\nindustrial action, flooding in parts of Asia and lockdowns in China.\\n Demand developments were not uniform across customer verticals. The main shift \\noccurred in retail and technology products where demand was exceptionally strong dur -\\ning the pandemic pushing container volumes well above their pre-pandemic trend (Figure 2). \\nDuring 2022, consumers reduced their spending on these products and container volumes \\nbegan to normalise. By contrast, other verticals such as lifestyle products did not experi-\\nence the same overconsumption and container volumes progressed in line with the pre-  \\npandemic trend. The automotive sector continued to be impacted by supply chain problems \\nand a shortage of semiconductors, as well as consumer hesitancy, resulting in container volumes being well below trend. From a sales channel perspective, e-commerce penetra-\\ntion also began to normalise during 2022, underscoring the need for nimble omnichannel \\nlogistics solutions.\\n Container volumes contracted across most ocean routes in 2022 compared to 2021 \\n(Figure 3). Volumes into and out of Europe weakened because of the Russian invasion of \\nUkraine that resulted in a direct loss of trade with Russia and in a deterioration of the \\nEuropean economic environment.

In H1 2022, supply side bottle-\\nnecks and the composition of demand led to a growing number of blank sailings and a \\nfleet deployment increasingly skewed towards longer East-West trades relative to shorter \\nintra-regional trades. This kept effective supply growth below head-haul demand growth, \\nsupporting ocean rates. Combined with weakening demand, the supply-demand balance \\ndeteriorated in H2 2022.\\n Looking forward to 2023, global demand for containers is expected to decline.

Emerging risks are established based on prevailing mega \\ntrends seen through different lenses (Figure 3). In 2021, two risks were selected for focus \\nand further analysis. These risks were the physical impact of climate change and change \\nin trade patterns. The planned analysis has been performed during 2022, and the outcome \\nis described below.\\n1 Climate change\\nClimate change will increasingly impact global trade. There will be impact on infrastructure \\nand transportation (the operation side) and changes to the patterns of economic activity \\nand trade flow (the demand side). \\n The analysis of the operation side includes assessment of climate scenarios and their \\nimpact on the company’s operations in relevant locations, i.e. the land-based assets. The \\nrisks are assessed for the portfolio of assets and for the individual assets. On average the \\nasset portfolio is predicted to incur 30% higher costs for physical damage and business \\ninterruption compared to a baseline of 2022. This does not include the potential impact on \\nthe network. For individual assets identified to be high-risk assets, the company is conduct -\\ning on site assessments by risk engineers of vulnerabilities to relevant climate hazards in \\nthe short, medium and long term and provide concrete and actionable recommendations.\\n In respect of climate change impact on the future trade flows, the analysis focuses \\non understanding the demand side, It captures the influence of climate change on where \\nthings are made and who buys them.

The findings are that irrespective of efforts to reduce global emissions, \\nthe global economy will be harmed in the medium or longer term depending on whether \\nthe scenario is a coordinated transition or a disorderly approach, and with a high degree of \\n variation between regions. \\n2 Change in trade patterns\\nA.P . Moller - Maersk’s business model is global and dependent on the global economy and \\ninternational trade. Consequently, fundamental changes in trade patterns could expose \\nthe current business model to risk. The company is monitoring trends in the global environ-\\nment leading to fragmentation in the key supply chains. Three main trends are contributing \\nto such fragmentation, 1) The geopolitical competition and supply chain disruptions are increasing the interest in re- or near-shoring, 2) Rise in protective industrial policy is lead-\\ning to government intervention in markets to prioritise local and regional production, 3) \\nPrioritisation of ESG goals is increasing the regulation, impacting businesses and impact -\\ning consumer preferences which is expected to lead to avoidance of long-haul transporta-\\ntion and manufacturing closer to market. A study was undertaken to analyse the geopolit -\\nical risk. Three scenarios were built with a view on the short-term, medium-term and long-\\nterm impact on the supply chains and detailed analyses were done on verticals (customer \\nproduct segments) that are globally important to trade and strategically important for \\nA.P . Moller - Maersk. The analysis concluded, that on current policy settings the impact on \\ncontainer trade will be manageable. However, certain tail events will increase risks within \\nthe scenarios exponentially. These tail risks relate to the geopolitical situation as well as \\nclimate change.', metadata={'source': '/Users/mrityunjay/Downloads/apmm-annual-report-2022.pdf', 'page': 34}),\n",

The hedging is a mix of \\nfair value hedging, combined fair value hedging and cash flow hedging.\\n The hedges are expected to be highly effective due to the nature of the economic relationship between the exposure \\nand the hedge. The source of ineffectiveness is the credit risk of the hedging instruments.
